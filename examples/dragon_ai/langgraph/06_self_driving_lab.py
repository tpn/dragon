06 - Self-driving lab: the full agentic-AI-on-HPC workflow.
=============================================================================
A SELF-DRIVING LAB on HPC -- the capstone, built on **Dragon + LangGraph**.

This combines the abilities from earlier examples into one workflow: an LLM
planner served on-cluster (03) proposes experiments, the data-plane discipline
from the crossover example (05) keeps bulk fields out of the coordinator, and a
supervisor watches runs live and aborts diverging ones mid-flight (04).
Experiments must be watched *while they run*, and a diverging run must be killed
*immediately* so its compute can be reclaimed for promising candidates.

This example shows all three pillars of why Dragon is powerful for agentic
AI on HPC, in ONE workflow:

  (A) LOCAL INFERENCE.  A planner agent calls an LLM served *on the cluster*
      by Dragon Inference (vLLM behind a queue -- no HTTP, no external API)
      to propose the next batch of experiments.  [Optional; rule-based
      fallback so the demo runs without GPUs.]

  (B) SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOW.  Each experiment is a small sinusoidal solver
      submitted as a Dragon **Batch** task, scheduled across the allocation.
      It writes both its live progress and its bulk output into a user-managed
      DDict (zero-copy, never through the coordinator).

  (C) REAL-TIME ACTION -- the headline.  Experiments STREAM progress into the
      DDict as they run.  A supervisor agent polls those DDict entries live
      and, the instant a run diverges, sets its abort flag in the DDict.  The
      experiment sees the flag and stops within one reporting interval.
      No waiting for completion.  No reading data after the fact.  The agent
      steers the lab in real time.

Why pure LangGraph cannot do this
---------------------------------
LangGraph nodes are opaque function calls: a node blocks until it returns,
and the framework has NO handle to the computation running inside it.  You
cannot observe a half-finished experiment, and you cannot stop it.  Dragon
gives the agent first-class handles -- Batch tasks and a shared DDict -- so the
agent can supervise and intervene mid-flight.  That is
an architectural capability, not a feature you can bolt on.

The flow
-----------------------------------------
This is a self-driving optimization campaign: an AI loop repeatedly (1) proposes
a batch of experiments, (2) runs them in parallel, (3) watches them live and
kills the bad ones early, and (4) inspects the survivors, keeps the best, and
decides whether to stop or iterate with better guesses.

It is an ordinary LangGraph ``StateGraph`` with three nodes wired into a cycle::

    START -> planner -> supervisor -> analyzer --(refine?)--> planner
                                          |
                                       (converged?) --> END

  * planner    -- proposes N candidate experiments (each is one parameter).
  * supervisor -- runs those N experiments and babysits them LIVE.
  * analyzer   -- ranks the finished ones, updates the "best so far", and takes
                  the conditional edge: refine (loop) or converged (END).

Three Dragon pieces sit underneath the graph:

  * DragonExecutor -- launches the AgentHost processes and runs each agent
                      inside one (this integration).  planner + analyzer run in
                      one host process; the supervisor runs in a second host
                      process on another node.
  * Batch          -- a separate Dragon scheduler that runs the experiment tasks
                      across the allocation.
  * DDict          -- a shared distributed dictionary; the "blackboard" that
                      every party reads and writes.

Placement: planner + analyzer share one host process (head node); the supervisor
runs in a second host process (compute node); Batch schedules the experiments
wherever there is room.

One round in detail -- what the supervisor actually does::

    receive the candidate list from the planner
      |
      +- for each candidate: submit it to Batch as a task  --> Batch runs the
      |    (submission returns immediately; tasks run async)    experiments
      |
      +- enter a POLL LOOP (every POLL_INTERVAL seconds):
            for each still-running experiment:
               read  progress:{id}  from the DDict   <-- experiments write here
               |
               +- if it looks like it is diverging:
               |     write  control:{id} = "abort"   --> experiment reads this
               |                                          flag and stops itself
               |
               +- if the Batch task finished:
                     record its outcome; drop it from the pending set
      |
      +- when all experiments are done/aborted -> return outcomes to the analyzer

The key mechanism is the DDict used as a two-way message board:

  * experiments WRITE their live progress   -> ``progress:{id}``
  * the supervisor READS that progress and, if a run goes bad, WRITES an abort
    flag                                     -> ``control:{id}``
  * the experiment READS its own abort flag each step and, if set, STOPS itself
    and reports "aborted".

That is the whole "real-time supervision" idea: nobody waits for an experiment
to finish before deciding it is a dud -- a diverging run is stopped mid-flight,
freeing its compute for the next round.

Run
---
    dragon examples/dragon_ai/langgraph/06_self_driving_lab.py            # rule-based judge
    USE_LLM_JUDGE=1 dragon examples/dragon_ai/langgraph/06_self_driving_lab.py   # + local LLM

Agents are placed across two hosts via ``Policy``: the control plane (planner +
analyzer) on the head node, the supervisor on a compute node. On a single-node
allocation both policies resolve to the same node and the demo still runs.
