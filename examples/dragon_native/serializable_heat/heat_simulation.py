"""
A 2D heat diffusion simulation split between Python and C++.

Python owns the simulation: it builds the grid, decomposes it into row bands,
starts a C++ worker per band and stitches the results back together after every
step. The C++ workers do the stencil arithmetic.

Nothing is passed to the workers on the command line except a serialized
Distributed Dictionary. The grid, the per worker bands, the Barrier used to
synchronize each step, the Semaphore used for the startup handshake and the
Queue used to report results are all stored in that dictionary and travel to
C++ as Serializables.

Run it with, for example:

    make
    dragon heat_simulation.py 4

The number of workers and the number of steps may both be given on the command
line, so `dragon heat_simulation.py 4 200` runs 200 steps across 4 workers.
